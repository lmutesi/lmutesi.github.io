         <p>I am a full time student doing my masters in Information Management Systems with a focus on product management and UX Design. 
        I recently made a big pivot into the tech industry because I am interested in building innovative and user centered products especially on the African continent.
        This decision was inspired by working on a project where I helped designed Rwanda's tech park known as Kigali Innovation City whose goal is to position Rwanda as Africa's tech hub.
        Working on the project emphasized my love for innovation and it's potential to transform the future of Africa and the globe in general.
        My dream industry to work for is fashiontech because I would like to sharpen creativity while also helping users get the most trendy and affordable styles.
